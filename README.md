Platform agnostic Rust driver for Sensirion SGPC3 gas sensor using the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal) traits.

## Sensirion SGPC3

Sensirion SGPC is a low-power accurate gas sensor for air quality application. The sensor has different sampling rates to optimize power-consumption per application bases as well as ability save and set the baseline for faster start-up accuracy. The sensor uses IÂ²C interface and measures TVOC (*Total Volatile Organic Compounds*)

Datasheet: https://www.sensirion.com/file/datasheet_sgpc3

## Development status
The sensor is feature complete and the future development evolves:
- Improving the documentation
- Moving into using Embedded-hal 1.x
- Improve crate module tests
- Maybe add async support (most waits are so short that it might not make sense)
